# ‚ö° Electricity Billing and Statistics System

This Python-based project simulates a **detailed electricity billing and consumption tracking system** for different user types such as Residential, Industry, Agricultural, Lighting, and Public/Private Services.  
It supports **single-time** and **multi-time** tariffs, and performs detailed tax, cost, and profit/loss analysis.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Run the script using Python 3.
2. Input consumer number (`0` to stop).
3. Choose consumer type:  
   `I/i` = Industry, `P/p` = PPO, `R/r` = Residential, `A/a` = Agricultural, `L/l` = Lighting
4. Choose tariff type:  
   `S/s` = Single-Time, `M/m` = Multi-Time
5. Enter the meter readings and days.
6. The program will calculate and print detailed billing and statistics.
7. At the end, full consumption statistics for Bornova will be printed.
